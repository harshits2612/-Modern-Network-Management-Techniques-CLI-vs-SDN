# 📡Modern-Network-Management-Techniques-CLI-vs-SDN
This project demonstrates a comparative analysis between traditional Command-Line Interface (CLI) based network management and modern Software Defined Networking (SDN) using Cisco Packet Tracer. It highlights differences in configuration style, control mechanisms, scalability, and operational efficiency.

# 📘 Overview
Traditional CLI-based network configuration on routers and switches

Centralized SDN-based control using the PT-Controller

Comparative study of:

Configuration complexity

Management scalability

Operational efficiency and usability

# 🖥️ Components Used
Cisco Packet Tracer

Routers: 3× Cisco ISR4331

Switches: LAN & Backbone switches

PT-Controller (for SDN simulation)

End-user PCs for testing and validation

# 🧪 Features Demonstrated
Static and dynamic routing setup

Fault-tolerant mesh topology for high availability

Centralized SDN configuration via PT-Controller

Walkthrough of CLI commands and configurations
# 📂 Files Included
Network_Topology.pkt – Cisco Packet Tracer simulation file

Report.pdf – Detailed documentation and analysis

# 📎 How to Run
Open the .pkt file using Cisco Packet Tracer (v8.x recommended).

Review CLI and SDN configurations in respective devices.

Refer to Report.pdf for step-by-step explanations and results.

# 📌 Conclusion
This project aims to showcase how SDN simplifies network management and enhances flexibility compared to traditional CLI methods, especially in larger or more dynamic network environments.
